Tips and tools for those keeping a five-mile-radius (5MR) list.

## What is 5MR?

A fun way to track nature sightings close to home. Here's the answer from [Jen Sanford](http://www.iusedtohatebirds.com/), who popularized the concept:

> The 5MR is a list of birds (or wildflowers, mammals, lizards, insects, trees, etc.) that you have seen within 5 miles of your home.
